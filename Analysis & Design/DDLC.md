# Database Development Life Cycle (DDLC) Notes

## Introduction
The Database Development Life Cycle (DDLC) is a structured process for developing and maintaining database systems. It ensures that the database meets organizational needs through a series of sequential phases. The major phases include:

1. **Planning**
2. **System Definition**
3. **Requirements Analysis**
4. **Database Design**
5. **DBMS Selection**
6. **Implementation**
7. **Maintenance**

Each phase builds upon the previous one, providing a systematic approach to database development. These notes are designed to help you prepare for theoretical exam questions, particularly 5-marker (detailed, 5-point answers) and 3-4 marker (shorter, 3-4 point answers) questions.

## Detailed Phases of the DDLC

### 1. Database Planning
- **Focus**: Management activities to initiate the project.
- **Key Activities**:
  - Review and approve the database project request to assess feasibility.
  - Prioritize the project based on urgency and importance.
  - Allocate resources, including money, people, and tools.
  - Arrange a development team with the necessary skills.
- **Additional Tasks**: Develop standards for data collection, format specifications, and documentation to ensure consistency.
- **Importance**: This phase sets the foundation by aligning the project with organizational goals.

### 2. System Definition
- **Purpose**: Define the scope, parameters, application areas, and user groups of the system.
- **Key Elements**:
  - **Scope**: Boundaries of the system (what is included/excluded).
  - **Parameters**: Specific constraints or variables (e.g., performance requirements).
  - **Application Areas**: Domains where the system will be used (e.g., education, finance).
  - **User Groups**: Categories of users (e.g., administrators, end-users).
- **Note**: Establishes clear boundaries to guide subsequent phases.

### 3. Requirements Analysis
- **Objective**: Understand the problem and collect user requirements.
- **Responsibility**: Conducted by an "Analyst."
- **Goals**:
  - Determine data requirements in terms of primitive objects (e.g., entities like Students, Courses).
  - Classify and describe information about these objects.
  - Identify and classify relationships among objects (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many).
  - Determine types of transactions and their interactions with data.
  - Identify rules governing data integrity (e.g., constraints, validation rules).
- **Activities**:
  - Problem understanding or analysis to comprehend user needs.
  - Requirement specifications to document detailed requirements.
- **Importance**: Provides the foundation for designing the database structure.

### 4. Database Design
- **Definition**: Creating a design that supports the enterprise’s operations and objectives.
- **Key Components**:
  - **Conceptual Schema Design**: Examines data requirements to produce a conceptual database schema.
  - **Transaction and Application Design**: Examines database applications to produce specifications for transactions and applications.
- **Framework**:
  - Determine information requirements.
  - Analyze real-world objects to model (e.g., Students, Courses, Instructors).
  - Determine primary key attributes (e.g., student_id for Students).
  - Develop rules for table access, population, and updates.
  - Identify relationships between entities (e.g., Student enrolls in multiple Courses).
  - Plan database security (e.g., access controls, encryption).
- **Example Entities and Attributes**:
  - **Students**: (student_id, Fname, Iname, phone, advisor_id)
  - **Advisors**: (advisor_id, Advisorname, Advisorphone)
  - **Instructors**: (instructor_id, Instructorname, Instructorphone)
  - **StudentCourses**: (Student_id, Course_id)
  - **Courses**: (Course_id, Coursedescription, instructor_id)
- **Example Data**:
  - **Students**: Al Gore (Advisor: Bill Clinton), Dan Quayle (Advisor: George Bush), George Bush (Advisor: Ronald Reagan), Walter Mondale (Advisor: Jimmy Carter).
  - **Courses**: 
    - VB1: Intro to Visual Basic (Instructor: McKinney)
    - DAO: Intro to DAO Programming (Instructor: Joe)
    - API: API Programming (Instructor: Dan Appleman)
    - DA1: Intro to DAO (Instructor: Joe)
    - OO: Object Oriented Programming in VB (Instructor: Deborah Kurata)
    - Client/Server Programming with VBSQL (Instructor: William Vaughn)

### 5. DBMS Selection
- **Objective**: Choose a suitable Database Management System (DBMS) to support the information system.
- **Factors to Consider**:
  - **Technical Factors**:
    - Type of DBMS (e.g., relational, object-oriented, NoSQL).
    - Storage structure and access methods (e.g., indexing, partitioning).
    - User and programmer interfaces available.
    - Query languages supported (e.g., SQL).
    - Development tools provided (e.g., GUI builders, ETL tools).
  - **Economical Factors**: Cost-effectiveness, including licensing, hardware, and maintenance costs.
- **Importance**: Ensures the DBMS aligns with the system’s technical and economic requirements.

### 6. Implementation
- **Timing**: Follows design and DBMS selection.
- **Purpose**: Construct and install the information system according to the plan and design.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Create database definitions (e.g., tables, indexes, constraints).
  - Develop applications (e.g., user interfaces, transaction processing systems).
  - Test the system (program tests, subsystem tests, system-wide tests).
  - Develop operational procedures and documentation.
  - Train users (lead users, trainers).
  - Populate the database with initial data.
- **Stages of Implementation**:
  - Hardware/Software Acquisition (if needed).
  - Programming to develop the system.
  - Testing (program, subsystem, system tests).
  - Training (lead users, train the trainer).
  - Conversion, using one of the following methods:
    - **Parallel**: Run old and new systems simultaneously for comparison.
    - **Pilot**: Implement on a small scale with limited scope.
    - **Phased**: Introduce critical functions first, then expand.
    - **Direct Cutover**: Switch directly to the new system with manual parallel operations.

### 7. Maintenance
- **Sub-phases**:
  - **Operational Maintenance**:
    - Begins once the system is operational.
    - Involves monitoring and maintaining the system.
    - Activities: Add/remove fields or tables, reorganize files (e.g., change access methods, drop/add indexes), optimize queries for performance.
  - **Database Maintenance**:
    - **Objectives**: Fix bugs (incorrect specifications or code), add enhanced functions, cycle back through SDLC phases for small-scale projects.
    - **End Result**: Achieve a fully functional "robust" system.
    - **Methods**: Audit the system to ensure integrity and performance.
    - **Risk Avoidance**: Monitor changing business requirements and set priorities.
- **Importance**: Ensures the system remains efficient and adaptable to evolving needs.
