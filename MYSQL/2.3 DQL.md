# üîç DQL - Data Query Language

Data Query Language (DQL) is used to fetch data from a database using the `SELECT` statement. It allows for filtering, sorting, and displaying data from tables with various clauses and operators.

---

## üìù **SELECT Command**

The `SELECT` statement is used to retrieve data from a database.

### üìå **Syntax**
```sql
-- Selecting specific columns
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name;

-- Selecting all columns
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

### üí° **Examples (Library Management System)**
```sql
-- Selecting the name of all books
SELECT Title FROM Books;

-- Selecting all details of books
SELECT * FROM Books;
```

---

## üéØ **SELECT with WHERE Clause**

The `WHERE` clause filters records that meet a specific condition.

### üìå **Syntax**
```sql
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

### üí° **Examples**
```sql
-- Selecting books with more than 5 copies available
SELECT * FROM Books WHERE CopiesAvailable > 5;

-- Selecting books by a specific author
SELECT Title FROM Books WHERE Author = 'George Orwell';
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Operators Allowed in WHERE Clause**

| Operator | Description                    |
|----------|--------------------------------|
| `=`      | Equal to                        |
| `<>` or `!=` | Not equal to                 |
| `>`      | Greater than                    |
| `<`      | Less than                       |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to        |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to           |
| `BETWEEN` | Between an inclusive range      |
| `LIKE`   | Search for a pattern            |
| `IN`     | Match any value in a list       |

---

## üìä **Using BETWEEN, IN, and LIKE Operators**

### üìç **BETWEEN Operator**
```sql
-- Selecting books published between 1990 and 2000
SELECT * FROM Books WHERE PublishedDate BETWEEN '1990-01-01' AND '2000-12-31';
```

### üìç **IN Operator**
```sql
-- Selecting books published on specific dates
SELECT * FROM Books WHERE PublishedDate IN ('1998-06-10', '2001-05-20');
```

### üìç **LIKE Operator**
```sql
-- Selecting books where the title starts with 'A'
SELECT * FROM Books WHERE Title LIKE 'A%';

-- Selecting books where the author's name starts with 'G'
SELECT * FROM Books WHERE Author LIKE 'G%';
```

---

## üîó **Combining AND, OR, and NOT Operators**

### üìå **Examples**
```sql
-- Selecting books that match multiple conditions
SELECT * FROM Books WHERE Genre = 'Fiction' AND CopiesAvailable > 5;

-- Using OR for alternative conditions
SELECT * FROM Books WHERE Author = 'George Orwell' OR Author = 'Paulo Coelho';

-- Combining AND & OR
SELECT * FROM Books WHERE Genre = 'Fiction' AND (Author = 'George Orwell' OR Author = 'Paulo Coelho');
```

---

## üîç **SELECT DISTINCT Statement**

The `DISTINCT` keyword returns only unique values from a column.

### üìå **Syntax**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name;
```

### üí° **Example**
```sql
-- Selecting unique genres of books
SELECT DISTINCT Genre FROM Books;
```

---

## üìà **Sorting Data: ORDER BY**

The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the result set in ascending (default) or descending order.

### üìå **Syntax**
```sql
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name(s) ASC|DESC;
```

### üí° **Examples**
```sql
-- Sorting books by title in ascending order
SELECT * FROM Books ORDER BY Title ASC;

-- Sorting books by published date in descending order
SELECT * FROM Books ORDER BY PublishedDate DESC;
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Creating a Table from Another Table**

### üìå **Syntax**
```sql
CREATE TABLE new_table AS SELECT column1, column2 FROM existing_table;
```

### üí° **Example**
```sql
-- Creating a new table with selected columns from Books
CREATE TABLE BestSellers AS SELECT Title, Author FROM Books;
```

---

## üì• **Inserting Data from Another Table**

The `INSERT INTO ... SELECT ...` statement is useful for copying data between tables.

### üìå **Syntax**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name SELECT column1, column2 FROM other_table;
```

### üí° **Example**
```sql
-- Inserting book data from Books table to BestSellers table
INSERT INTO BestSellers SELECT Title, Author FROM Books WHERE CopiesAvailable > 10;
```
