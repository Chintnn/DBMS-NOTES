# 📌 **Relational Query Language**

Relational Query Language is a fundamental part of database management that allows users to retrieve, manipulate, and manage data stored in relational databases. It consists of two primary approaches:

1. **Relational Algebra**
2. **Relational Calculus**

---

## 🔷 **1. Relational Algebra**
Relational Algebra is a procedural query language that uses a set of operations to retrieve data from relational databases. It defines a sequence of operations to be performed on relations (tables) to extract desired results.

### 🏷️ **A. Basic Operations in Relational Algebra**

### 1️⃣ **Selection (σ) – Filtering Rows**
📌 **Purpose**: Selects rows from a relation that satisfy a given condition.

📌 **Syntax**:
```
σ condition (Relation)
```
📌 **Example**:
```
σ Age > 30 (Employee)
```
✅ Retrieves all employees older than 30.

📌 **Example Table: Employee**

| Emp_ID | Name  | Age | Department |
|--------|-------|-----|------------|
| 101    | Alice | 28  | HR         |
| 102    | Bob   | 35  | IT         |
| 103    | Carol | 40  | Sales      |
| 104    | Dave  | 23  | IT         |

📌 **Result after** `σ Age > 30 (Employee)`

| Emp_ID | Name  | Age | Department |
|--------|-------|-----|------------|
| 102    | Bob   | 35  | IT         |
| 103    | Carol | 40  | Sales      |

---

### 2️⃣ **Projection (π) – Selecting Columns**
📌 **Purpose**: Selects specific columns from a relation.

📌 **Syntax**:
```
π column1, column2, ... (Relation)
```
📌 **Example**:
```
π Name, Salary (Employee)
```
✅ Retrieves only `Name` and `Salary` columns from `Employee` table.

📌 **Example Table: Employee**

| Emp_ID | Name  | Age | Salary  |
|--------|-------|-----|---------|
| 101    | Alice | 28  | 50,000  |
| 102    | Bob   | 35  | 60,000  |
| 103    | Carol | 40  | 70,000  |
| 104    | Dave  | 23  | 45,000  |

📌 **Result after** `π Name, Salary (Employee)`

| Name  | Salary  |
|-------|---------|
| Alice | 50,000  |
| Bob   | 60,000  |
| Carol | 70,000  |
| Dave  | 45,000  |

---

### 3️⃣ **Union (∪) – Combining Relations**
📌 **Purpose**: Returns all tuples from two relations while removing duplicates.

📌 **Syntax**:
```
Relation1 ∪ Relation2
```
📌 **Example**:
```
π Name (Employee1) ∪ π Name (Employee2)
```
✅ Retrieves names from both `Employee1` and `Employee2` without duplicates.

📌 **Example Tables**

#### Employee1:

| Name  |
|-------|
| Alice |
| Bob   |
| Carol |

#### Employee2:

| Name  |
|-------|
| Bob   |
| Dave  |

📌 **Result after** `π Name (Employee1) ∪ π Name (Employee2)`

| Name  |
|-------|
| Alice |
| Bob   |
| Carol |
| Dave  |

---

### 4️⃣ **Set Difference (-) – Finding Differences**
📌 **Purpose**: Retrieves tuples present in one relation but not in the other.

📌 **Syntax**:
```
Relation1 - Relation2
```
📌 **Example**:
```
π Name (Employee1) - π Name (Employee2)
```
✅ Retrieves employees present in `Employee1` but not in `Employee2`.

📌 **Result after** `π Name (Employee1) - π Name (Employee2)`

| Name  |
|-------|
| Alice |
| Carol |

---

### 5️⃣ **Cartesian Product (×) – Combining Relations**
📌 **Purpose**: Combines all tuples of one relation with all tuples of another.

📌 **Syntax**:
```
Relation1 × Relation2
```
📌 **Example**:
```
Employee × Department
```
✅ Generates all possible employee-department pairs.

📌 **Example Tables**

#### Employee:

| Emp_ID | Name  |
|--------|-------|
| 101    | Alice |
| 102    | Bob   |

#### Department:

| Dept_ID | Dept_Name |
|---------|----------|
| 1       | IT       |
| 2       | HR       |

📌 **Result after** `Employee × Department`

| Emp_ID | Name  | Dept_ID | Dept_Name |
|--------|-------|---------|----------|
| 101    | Alice | 1       | IT       |
| 101    | Alice | 2       | HR       |
| 102    | Bob   | 1       | IT       |
| 102    | Bob   | 2       | HR       |

---

### 6️⃣ **Join (⨝) – Merging Relations Based on Common Attributes**
📌 **Purpose**: Combines related tuples from two relations based on a common attribute.

📌 **Syntax**:
```
Relation1 ⨝ condition Relation2
```
📌 **Example**:
```
Employee ⨝ Employee.Dept_ID = Department.Dept_ID Department
```
✅ Retrieves only employees with matching departments.

📌 **Example Tables**

#### Employee:

| Emp_ID | Name  | Dept_ID |
|--------|-------|---------|
| 101    | Alice | 1       |
| 102    | Bob   | 2       |

#### Department:

| Dept_ID | Dept_Name |
|---------|----------|
| 1       | IT       |
| 2       | HR       |

📌 **Result after** `Employee ⨝ Employee.Dept_ID = Department.Dept_ID Department`

| Emp_ID | Name  | Dept_ID | Dept_Name |
|--------|-------|---------|----------|
| 101    | Alice | 1       | IT       |
| 102    | Bob   | 2       | HR       |

## 🔷 **2. Relational Calculus**
Relational Calculus is a **non-procedural query language** that specifies **what to retrieve** rather than **how to retrieve** it.

### 🏷️ **Types of Relational Calculus**
1. **Tuple Relational Calculus (TRC)**
2. **Domain Relational Calculus (DRC)**

---

### 🔹 **A. Tuple Relational Calculus (TRC)**
📌 **Purpose**: Retrieves tuples from a relation based on conditions.

📌 **Syntax**:
```
{t | Condition(t)}
```
📌 **Example**:
```
{t | t ∈ Employee AND t.Salary > 50000}
```
✅ Retrieves all employees earning more than 50,000.

---

### 🔹 **B. Domain Relational Calculus (DRC)**
📌 **Purpose**: Uses domain variables (column values) instead of tuples.

📌 **Syntax**:
```
{<column1, column2> | Condition(column1, column2)}
```
📌 **Example**:
```
{<Name, Salary> | ∃ e ∈ Employee (e.Name = Name AND e.Salary > 50000)}
```
✅ Retrieves names and salaries of employees earning more than 50,000.

## 🔷 **3. Difference Between Relational Algebra and Relational Calculus**

| Feature | Relational Algebra | Relational Calculus |
|---------|--------------------|----------------------|
| Type | Procedural | Non-Procedural |
| Approach | Specifies **how** to retrieve data | Specifies **what** to retrieve |
| Operations | Uses **operators** like selection, projection, join, etc. | Uses **logical expressions** to filter tuples |
| Complexity | Easier to optimize | More flexible but harder to optimize |

---

## 📌 **Summary of Concepts**
✅ **Relational Algebra**: Defines a sequence of operations to retrieve data.  
✅ **Relational Calculus**: Uses logical expressions to specify desired results. 
✅ **Selection (σ)**: Filters rows based on conditions. 
✅ **Projection (π)**: Selects specific columns. 
✅ **Join (⨝)**: Combines tables based on conditions. 
✅ **Union (∪), Intersection (∩), Difference (-)**: Set operations in relational algebra. 
✅ **TRC & DRC**: Two types of relational calculus using tuple or domain variables.
