# 📌 PL/SQL: A Procedural Extension of SQL

## 🔹 Introduction to PL/SQL
- SQL lacks procedural capabilities like **looping, branching, and conditional checks**, which are essential for **data validation and manipulation**.
- **PL/SQL** (Procedural Language extension of SQL) is provided by Oracle to overcome this limitation.
- **Use Cases:**
  - **Validation** before storing data.
  - **Manipulation** of table data efficiently.

## 🔹 Features of PL/SQL
PL/SQL **extends SQL** by incorporating:
- **SQL Data Manipulation Statements:** `INSERT`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
- **SQL Transaction Processing Statements:** `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`
- **SQL Functions** and **SQL Predicates** (`BETWEEN...AND`, `EXISTS`)
- **Logical Operators:** `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`
- **Programming Constructs:**
  - ✅ **Assignment Statements**: `A := B + C;`
  - ✅ **Flow Control Statements**: `IF...THEN...ELSE`
  - ✅ **Iterative Statements**: `FOR...LOOP`, `WHILE...LOOP`

## 🔹 PL/SQL Block Structure 🏗️
A **PL/SQL block** is a standard **code segment** consisting of three sections:

### 1️⃣ Declaration Section ✏️
- Used to **declare variables, cursors, constants, subprograms**.
- Begins with the keyword **DECLARE**.

### 2️⃣ Executable Section ⚙️
- Contains **SQL queries** and **PL/SQL statements**.
- Begins with the keyword **BEGIN** and ends with **END**.
- Must include **at least one executable statement**.

### 3️⃣ Exception Handling Section ❗
- Handles **errors** and **exceptions** that occur during execution.
- Begins with the keyword **EXCEPTION**.

### 📌 PL/SQL Block Syntax
```bash
DECLARE
   variable_name datatype;
BEGIN
   -- SQL statements and logic
   variable_name := value;
   DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(variable_name);
EXCEPTION
   WHEN exception_name THEN
   -- Handle the exception
   DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Error Occurred');
END;
/
```

## 🔹 Advantages of PL/SQL 🚀
PL/SQL offers several benefits:

1️⃣ **Procedural Capabilities** ✨
   - Allows **looping, branching, and condition handling**.
   - Enhances control over SQL execution.

2️⃣ **Improved Performance** ⚡
   - **Reduces network traffic** by sending multiple SQL statements in a single block.
   - Optimized **execution engine** improves efficiency.

3️⃣ **Enhanced Productivity** 💡
   - Code **reusability** with procedures and functions.
   - Allows **modular** programming.

4️⃣ **Portability** 🌍
   - Runs on any **Oracle database**.
   - Compatible across **different platforms**.

5️⃣ **Integration with RDBMS** 🔗
   - Works seamlessly with **relational database management systems (RDBMS)**.
   - Supports **transactions** and ensures **data integrity**.

## 📌 Summary 📖
- **PL/SQL** extends SQL by adding procedural capabilities like **loops, conditions, and exception handling**.
- It consists of **three main sections**: Declaration, Executable, and Exception Handling.
- PL/SQL supports **SQL operations** (`SELECT`, `INSERT`, etc.), **flow control**, and **iterative constructs**.
- It provides **better performance, modularity, and integration** with databases.
