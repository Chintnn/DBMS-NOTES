# 👥 Group By in SQL

## 🤔 What is Group By?

The `GROUP BY` statement in SQL is used to 🗂️ arrange identical data into groups. It is often used with aggregate functions (such as 📊 COUNT, 🚦 MAX, 📉 MIN, ➕ SUM, 📐 AVG) to perform operations on each group of data independently.

### 🔑 Key Points:
- **📌 Purpose**: To aggregate data and generate summarized results.
- **⚙️ How It Works**: Rows with the same values in specified columns are combined into groups.
- **📝 Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, aggregate_function(column3)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column1, column2;
```

### ✅ **Example:**
Suppose you have a **Student** table:

| **StudentID** | **Name** | **Department** | **Marks** |
|---------------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| 1             | Aakash    | CSE            | 85        |
| 2             | Bharat    | CSE            | 90        |
| 3             | Charu     | ECE            | 78        |
| 4             | Divya     | CSE            | 88        |
| 5             | Esha      | ECE            | 91        |

If you want to find the **average marks** of students in each **department**, you can use:
```sql
SELECT Department, AVG(Marks) AS "Average Marks"
FROM Student
GROUP BY Department;
```

### 📊 **Output:**
| **Department** | **Average Marks** |
|----------------|-------------------|
| CSE            | 87.67             |
| ECE            | 84.50             |

## 👥 Example 1: Counting Employees per Department

### 🗂️ Table: `emp`
| 👨‍💼 empno | 👤 ename  | 💼 job    | 🏢 deptno |
|------------|------------|-----------|------------|
| 1          | seema      | faculty   | 10         |
| 2          | priti      | faculty   | 20         |
| 3          | chahita    | faculty   | 10         |
| 4          | asha       | faculty   | 30         |

### 💻 Query:
```sql
SELECT deptno, COUNT(empno) AS "No of employees"
FROM emp
GROUP BY deptno;
```

### 📊 Output:
| 🏢 deptno | 👥 No of employees |
|------------|---------------------|
| 10         | 2                   |
| 20         | 1                   |
| 30         | 1                   |

## 💳 Example 2: Accounts by Type and Branch

### 🗂️ Table: `account`
| 🏦 acc_no | 💳 type    | 🏠 branch_no |
|------------|-------------|--------------|
| 100        | saving      | 10           |
| 200        | current     | 20           |
| 300        | saving      | 20           |

## 🎯 **Key Takeaways for Exam Preparation - GROUP BY**

---

### ✅ **When to Use GROUP BY:**
- When you need to **aggregate data** based on specific **columns**.
- To **summarize data** like **total sales per region** or **average marks per department**.

### 📌 **Common Scenarios:**

| 🔢 **Scenario**                       | **Example Query**                                                |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Count Students per Department**     | `SELECT Department, COUNT(*) FROM Student GROUP BY Department;`  |
| **Average Marks by Department**       | `SELECT Department, AVG(Marks) FROM Student GROUP BY Department;`|
| **Total Sales by Region**             | `SELECT Region, SUM(Sales) FROM Orders GROUP BY Region;`         |
| **Filter Groups with HAVING**         | `SELECT Department, AVG(Marks) FROM Student GROUP BY Department HAVING AVG(Marks) > 85;` |

---

### 🛠️ **Pro Tips for Exams:**
- **GROUP BY** is often used with **aggregate functions** like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`.
- Use **HAVING** to filter **aggregated data**, not **WHERE**, which is used before **GROUP BY**.
- Always include **non-aggregated columns** in the **GROUP BY** clause.

---

### 💡 **Example Scenario for Exams:**
*"How would you find the **total sales** for each **salesperson** where the **total exceeds $10,000**?"*
```sql
SELECT Salesperson, SUM(Sales) AS "Total Sales"
FROM SalesData
GROUP BY Salesperson
HAVING SUM(Sales) > 10000;
```

---

### 🚀 **Advanced Query Tip:**
- You can use **GROUP BY** with **JOINs** to aggregate data from **multiple tables**.
- Example: Calculate the **total sales per product category** by **joining sales** and **products table**:
```sql
SELECT p.Category, SUM(s.Sales) AS "Total Sales"
FROM Sales s
JOIN Products p ON s.ProductID = p.ProductID
GROUP BY p.Category;
```

---

### 📖 **Why GROUP BY Matters in Real-World Scenarios:**
- **Data Analysis:** Summarizes **large datasets** into **meaningful insights**.
- **Reporting:** Essential for **creating reports** like **monthly sales**, **departmental performance**, and **resource allocation**.
- **Business Intelligence:** Enables **decision-making** by providing **aggregated views of data**.
