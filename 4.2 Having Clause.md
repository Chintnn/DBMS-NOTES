# 🤌 HAVING Clause in SQL

## 🤔 What is the HAVING Clause?

The `HAVING` clause in SQL is used to **filter groups** of data after aggregation. It is typically used with the `GROUP BY` clause to set conditions on the aggregated data, similar to how the `WHERE` clause is used with non-aggregated data.

### 🔑 Key Points:
- **📌 Purpose**: To filter aggregated results.
- **🛠️ When to Use**: When applying conditions on aggregate functions (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`).
- **📝 Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1
HAVING aggregate_function(column2) condition;
```

## 👥 Example 1: Counting Employees per Department with a Condition

### 🗂️ Table: `emp`
| 👨‍💼 empno | 👤 ename  | 💼 job    | 🏢 deptno |
|------------|------------|-----------|------------|
| 1          | seema      | faculty   | 10         |
| 2          | priti      | faculty   | 20         |
| 3          | chahita    | faculty   | 10         |
| 4          | asha       | faculty   | 30         |

### 💻 Query: Show departments with more than 1 employee
```sql
SELECT deptno, COUNT(empno) AS "No of employees"
FROM emp
GROUP BY deptno
HAVING COUNT(empno) > 1;
```

### 📊 Output:
| 🏢 deptno | 👥 No of employees |
|-----------|---------------------|
| 10        | 2                   |

## 💳 Example 2: Accounts by Type and Branch with a Minimum Account Requirement

### 🗂️ Table: `account`
| 🏦 acc_no | 💳 type    | 🏠 branch_no |
|------------|-------------|--------------|
| 100        | saving      | 10           |
| 200        | current     | 20           |
| 300        | saving      | 20           |
| 300        | salary      | 20           |
| 400        | current     | 30           |
| 500        | current     | 10           |

### 💻 Query: Show branches with more than 1 "saving" account
```sql
SELECT branch_no, type, COUNT(acc_no) AS "no of accounts"
FROM account
WHERE type = 'saving'
GROUP BY branch_no, type
HAVING COUNT(acc_no) > 1;
```

### 📊 Output:
| 🏠 branch_no | 💳 type | 🔢 no of accounts |
|--------------|----------|-------------------|
| 20           | saving   | 2                 |

## 💰 Example 3: Average Salary by Job and Department with a Minimum Average Salary

### 🗂️ Table: `emp`
| 👨‍💼 empno | 👤 ename   | 💼 job       | 🏢 deptno | 💵 salary   |
|------------|------------|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| 1          | seema      | faculty     | 10        | 25000.00     |
| 2          | priti      | faculty     | 20        | 10000.00     |
| 3          | chahita    | faculty     | 10        | 23000.00     |
| 4          | asha       | faculty     | 30        | 10000.00     |
| 5          | nisha      | instructor  | 20        | 5000.00      |
| 6          | geeta      | TA          | 20        | 7000.00      |
| 7          | umesh      | TA          | 10        | 8000.00      |
| 8          | suresh     | instructor  | 10        | 9000.00      |

### 💻 Query: Show job roles with an average salary above 8000
```sql
SELECT job, deptno, AVG(salary) AS "avg_salary"
FROM emp
GROUP BY job, deptno
HAVING AVG(salary) > 8000;
```

### 📊 Output:
| 💼 job       | 🏢 deptno | 💵 avg_salary |
|--------------|------------|---------------|
| faculty     | 10         | 24000.00      |
| faculty     | 20         | 10000.00      |
| instructor  | 10         | 9000.00       |

## 🎯 **Summary of HAVING Clause**

| 🆎 **Function** | **Description** | **Syntax** | **Example** |
|-----------------|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| **HAVING** | Filters groups after aggregation | `SELECT column1, aggregate(column2) FROM table_name GROUP BY column1 HAVING condition;` | `SELECT deptno, COUNT(*) FROM emp GROUP BY deptno HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;` |

---

## 📌 **When to Use HAVING vs WHERE:**

| 💻 **Clause** | **Usage Scenario** | **Example** |
|---------------|--------------------|-------------|
| **WHERE** | To filter rows **before aggregation** | `WHERE salary > 10000` |
| **HAVING** | To filter **groups of rows after aggregation** | `HAVING AVG(salary) > 8000` |

## 🛠️ **Pro Tips for Exams:**

- Use **HAVING** with **aggregate functions** like `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`.
- **WHERE** is for **raw data filtering**, while **HAVING** is for **aggregated data**.
- You can combine **WHERE** and **HAVING** in the **same query** for **precise filtering**.

---

## 💡 **Example Scenario for Exams:**

*"How would you find the **departments** with an **average salary** above **15,000** where only **faculty** members work?"*

```sql
SELECT deptno, AVG(salary) AS "avg_salary"
FROM emp
WHERE job = 'faculty'
GROUP BY deptno
HAVING AVG(salary) > 15000;
```

---

## 🚀 **Advanced Query Tip:**

- You can combine **GROUP BY** and **HAVING** with **JOINs** to filter **aggregated results** from **multiple tables**.
- Example: Find **product categories** with **total sales** above **$5000**:
```sql
SELECT p.Category, SUM(s.Sales) AS "Total Sales"
FROM Sales s
JOIN Products p ON s.ProductID = p.ProductID
GROUP BY p.Category
HAVING SUM(s.Sales) > 5000;
```

## 📖 **Why HAVING Matters in Real-World Scenarios:**

- **Data Validation**: Filter out **undesired aggregated results**.
- **Reporting**: Create **customized reports** with **threshold-based data**.
- **Business Intelligence**: Apply **business rules** on **summarized data** for **better decision-making**.
